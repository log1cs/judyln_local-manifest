# LG G7 ThinQ Build manifest #

### Sync ###
Once you initialized your repo instance, paste the following into your terminal window
```bash
git clone https://github.com/log1cs/judyln_local-manifest.git --depth 1 -b main .repo/local_manifests
```
Then sync your manifest by repo sync.

Huge credits to @EmanuelCN0 for these trees!
